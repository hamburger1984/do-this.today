- **Enhanced Focus**: The Randomize button and task list are prominently featured

- **Cream Background** (`#fef9f3`) - Main background for comfortable viewing
- **Coral Accent** (`#f7931e`) - Hover states and warnings

### Design Philosophy
The new theme prioritizes:
- **Eye comfort** with bright, warm backgrounds
- **Visual hierarchy** that draws attention to key actions
