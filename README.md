# Task Dice

A mobile-first Progressive Web App that helps you decide what to do next by randomly selecting from your personal task list. Perfect for managing both one-time tasks and daily routines with smart cooldown periods.

- **Two task types** - One-time tasks you complete once, or repeatable tasks with cooldowns
- **8-hour focus timer** - When you accept a task, you get 8 hours to complete it
- **Works offline** - Install as an app on your phone and use anywhere
- **Privacy-first** - All your data stays on your device, no accounts needed

  - No cooldown (always available)

### Task Status
- ✅ **Available** (green) - Ready to be picked
